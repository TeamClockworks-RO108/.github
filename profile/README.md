## :question: Who are we?
> For more detailed information, visit www.teamclockworks.ro

We are the official Github organization for FTC team Clockworks RO-108, competing every year and trying to aim further each time. We are formed of 15 **official members**, from __3 separate departments.__

We believe in both open-source hardware and software and we strive to publish our innovations, developments and efforts into open-source projects on this profile. 

Voron printers are the backbone of our innovation machine. We are continously building more and more projects and mods:

| 🔧 Filametrix Axon servo actuated depressor | 🗺️ DragonBurner Cartographer/Beacon mount | ⚙️ Stepper Blobifier | 🖥️ BTT HDMI5 V1.2 display mount (Clicky-Clack, more USB space) | 📷 Voron 0 Raspberry Pi Camera Mount (upside down mounting) |
